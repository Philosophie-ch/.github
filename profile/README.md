Philosophie-ch
======

Philosophie-ch is the GitHub organization for the association [philosophie.ch](https://philosophie.ch), dedicated to promote Philosophy in Switzerland and beyond.


The philosophie.ch website
-------------------------------

The code of main portal of the association is managed by ourselves.
Our goal is to provide our visitors with a great, multi-lingual experience for everything regarding Philosophy.
We strive to provide a platform for philosophers to write and share their own content, in particular, articles, and in the case of institutions, also events.
As a team, put a lot of work in improving the experience when using the portal.

We also provide different services to the academic journal [Dialectica](https://dialectica.philsoophie.ch).


Development for philosophie.ch
-----------------------

We're publishing here different software tools that may be reused independently, by anyone interested, so feel free to clone and use our code.
At the moment, most of the code here are simple shell scripts or small coding projects developed ad hoc to solve specific problems we've encountered.
The main exception is:

* `dltc-csl`: here we keep track of the changes to the CSL used to render the bibliographic entries and bibliographies of Dialectica's articles.

Due to copyright and some permissions issues, the code of our portal and our Dockerfiles that define the compilation environment for Dialectica's articles remain private.
More substantial code can be found at our sibling GitHub organization, [dialoa](https://github.com/dialoa/), where we share code related to the production of Dialectica.
